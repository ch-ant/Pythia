#### <div align="center">Java library that produces an automated statistical profile of an input dataset.</div>

A standard dataset is just a text file, with lines, where each line is a record, the fields of which are separated by a
separator (eg. tabs, comma, pipe, etc). After registering a dataset and declaring the desired data analysis methods that should get executed, the system produces a 100% automatic statistical profile of the dataset and generates reports of the findings.
